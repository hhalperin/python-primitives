# Python Primitives & Core Concepts

Here is a comprehensive, example-driven study guide for mastering Python fundamentals, core language features, and essential programming concepts. This repository is designed for learners, self-studiers, and anyone preparing for Python technical interviews.

## What is this repository?

This project is a structured collection of concise lessons and runnable code examples covering the most important primitives and patterns in Python. Each topic is organized in its own folder, with:
- **Markdown notes** explaining the concept, key points, and common pitfalls
- **Python code examples** demonstrating real usage questions

## Topics Covered

- Data Types & Variables (int, float, str, bool, None, type annotations)
- Mutability vs. Immutability
- Variable Assignment & References
- Type Conversion
- Unpacking & Star Expressions
- Collections (lists, tuples, sets, dicts)
- Copying Objects (shallow vs. deep copy)
- Slicing
- Basic Operations & Built-in Functions
- Control Flow (if, for, while, break, continue, match/case)
- Practical Control Patterns (ternary, walrus, chained comparisons)
- Functions & Recursion (*args, **kwargs, closures, advanced features)
- Input/Output (print, input, formatting)
- Comments, PEP8, and Pythonic Code
- String Methods & Formatting (f-strings, format, % operator)
- Comprehensions & Functional Programming (map, filter, reduce, lambda)
- Decorators
- Exception Handling & Common Pitfalls
- Modules, Packages, and File Handling (including pathlib)
- Context Managers
- OOP (classes, dataclasses, inheritance, encapsulation)
- Scope & Namespaces (LEGB, global, nonlocal)
- Identity, Hashing, and Equality
- Iterators & Generators (yield, generator expressions)
- Advanced Iteration Tools (itertools, collections.Counter, defaultdict, deque)
- Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
- Simple Unit Testing (unittest)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion)
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Structure

Each topic is organized as:

```
primitives/
  <topic_folder>/
    <subtopic>/
      lesson.md   # Explanatory notes
      lesson.py   # Code examples & practice
```

Some advanced topics (e.g., algorithms, visualization) include additional example scripts.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders for any topic you want to study or review
- Read the markdown notes for clear explanations and best practices
- Run the Python code examples to see concepts in action
- Use the included questions for self-testing 

## Why use this repo?

- **Breadth:** Covers all the core Python primitives and patterns you need
- **Clarity:** Each concept is explained with both notes and code
- **Practice:** Includes questions and practical examples
- **Reference:** Great for quick lookups and artifact in repositories while building
