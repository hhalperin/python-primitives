# Output
print("Welcome to Python!")

# Input (uncomment to use in a real script)
# user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
# print("You entered:", user_input)

# Output with formatting
score = 95
print(f"Your score is {score}.")

# Custom separator and end
print("A", "B", "C", sep=", ", end="!\n")  # A, B, C!

# 1. What type does input() return, and how do you convert it to an integer?
# 2. How can you print multiple values on the same line in Python?
